# Pizza Pursuit (Working Title)

## Game Overview: 
Isometric pizza delivery game. Deliver as many pizzas as possible.

## Design Pillars:
City Driving: Driving around the map should be fun and fast-paced. Better driving improves customer tips and number of orders. Worse driving costs money to pay to fix the car and to pay for damaged property.

Business Decisions: The player has to make decisions between upgrading the car, upgrading the business (e.g., more phone lines, more locations), pizza making inventory.

Challenges: Pizza-related minigames, e.g., deliver 10 pizzas in 30 seconds. This provides rewards that help with the game. 

## Mechanics Summary:
The map is random every time the user starts a game. The user has 5 minutes to get as much money as possible. The net worth of the user is the score that is recorded on the leaderboard.

The player starts with one pizza shop. They have a pre-determined inventory of supplies: dough, sauce, toppings, boxes. Every time they receive an order, the supplies decrease, and they get a timer to go from the pizza shop to the delivery location. The faster they deliver, the more the customer pays (tips). If the pizza is late, the customer may pay for the pizza without a tip or may refuse the pizza. If the player crashes into other cars or pedestrians while driving, the player has to pay lawsuits.

The player can spend their money to:
- Buy pizza supplies - this doesn't increase net worth, but it is necessary to make pizzas. If you are out of pizza making supplies, you can't take orders.
- Fix the car: the car is damaged from running into things (in addition to paying lawsuits).
- Improve the car: faster car, takes more damage, allows you to deliver more than one pizza at a time.
- Improve the pizza store: more ovens, more phone lines, take internet orders, more locations.
- Pay employees: more people to make pizzas, answer the phones, deliver pizzas.

If the player is out of money, they can play a minigame that will award them some money (necessary if they are out of money and out of pizza supplies).
